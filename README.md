# ConfidenceSets

This repository contains scripts and programs to reproduce select analyses from the paper:

Willis, A. **Confidence Sets for Phylogenetic Trees.** *Journal of the American Statistical Association*, 114 (525), 235-244.

Scripts here particularly pertain to the results of Sections 5 and 6, including Table 1.

# Program availability

The directory `TreePrograms` contains a number of Java scripts that you may find helpful in reproducing some of the analyses. Much of the source code is intellectual property of Professor Tom Nye of Newcastle University, who generously shared with me his Java classes for trees. For this reason, the Java source code is not available. If there is a missing jar (Java executable) file please do not hesitate to reach out to me and I will do my best to make it available to you.
