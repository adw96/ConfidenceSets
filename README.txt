README

This repository pertains to my confidence sets for phylogenetic trees paper:
Willis, A. (2016). Confidence sets for phylogenetic trees. arXiv:1607:08288.

It is intended to document my code and analysis from Sections 5 and 6, including Table 1. 

Please note that I do not intend to publish the source code of the log map function at this stage. While the implementation of the log map function is my own code, Professor Tom Nye of Newcastle University generously shared with me his Java classes for trees, including an implementation of the polynomial geodesic algorithm of Owen and Provan (2011). Thus because not all of the necessary source code is my own intellectual property, please email both me and Professor Nye source requests.

TODO
- Upload scripts for Sections 6.

If you are particularly interested in seeing the above or something else here, please email me and I will do my best to oblige!
